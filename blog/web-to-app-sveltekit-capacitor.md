You can build a website and turn it into an app with CapacitorJS.

CapacitorJS allows you to wrap any standard web application (HTML/CSS/JS) into a native shell for Android and iOS. While frameworks like Astro work well, this guide focuses on my preferred stack: **SvelteKit + Capacitor**.

In this post I’ll walk through the setup I use:
- SvelteKit for the actual app (static build)
- Capacitor for Android & iOS
- Adjustments for live (hot module) reload inside the Android emulator

## General steps:

We will do the following:
1. Create a project using SvelteKit.
2. Add Capacitor to this SvelteKit project.
3. Change the build output to static.
4. Add the mobile platforms (Android & iOS)
5. Implement live / hot module reload so that changes instantly show up in the Android emulator.

### 1. Step: Set up SvelteKit

First we want to add things relevant to the website, in this case SvelteKit.

Use the command `npx sv create my-app`.

Choose whatever options you want, but take `pnpm`, not `npm`, the last few times I ran into problems with it.

### 2. Step: Add Capacitor

Run `pnpm install @capacitor/core @capacitor/cli` which installs the Capacitor core library and the command line interface (CLI).

Then `npx cap init`.

### 3. Step: Changing to static

Now make the output static. For this first add the SvelteKit static adapter with `pnpm add -D @sveltejs/adapter-static`. 

Add the file `src/routes/+layout.js` that has the following one line:

```JavaScript
export const prerender = true;
```

Change the `capacitor.config.json` file to be output at `build`. So change the value of it to build like so: `"webDir": "build",`.

Your files might look slightly different if your are using TypeScript, the underlying step stays the same even if the syntax and file ending looks slightly different.

Then change your `svelte.config.js` file to:

```
import adapter from '@sveltejs/adapter-static';
import { vitePreprocess } from '@sveltejs/vite-plugin-svelte';

/** @type {import('@sveltejs/kit').Config} */
const config = {
    preprocess: vitePreprocess(),
    kit: {
        adapter: adapter({
            pages: 'build',
            assets: 'build',
            fallback: null,
            precompress: false,
            strict: true
        })
    }
};
export default config;
```

Now `pnpm run dev` will already work and you can look at your website at `localhost:5173`. 

### 4. Step: Adding mobile platforms

Now we are very close to being able to run our web app on a mobile device.

Adding Android:

```
pnpm install @capacitor/android
npx cap add android
pnpm run build
npx cap sync
```

 Next step is to install [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio) and setup an emulator for this to work.

Now to open the project's Android version with an Android emulator do `npx cap open android`. 

Apple makes developing for iOS a lot harder (for no good reason). I won't explore Virtual Machines, remote access to macOS devices or other solutions in this blog post. But generally this will "need" a device running macOS and Xcode.

> If you are using Visual Studio Code I also highly recommend the [webnative extension](https://webnative.dev/).

### 5. Step: Live / Hot module reload (optional)

Currently any changes require a rebuild to show up in the Android emulator, but we want our changes to show up instantly.

> Make sure to undo this when you build the app for production, so when you actually want to release it.

For that we need to adjust the `vite.config.js` and `capacitor.config.json`.

To vite.config.js add this:
```
server: {
    host: '0.0.0.0',
    port: 5173,
}
```

To capacitor.config.json add this:
```
server: {
    url: 'http://10.0.2.2:5173',
    cleartext: true
}
```

<details> <summary> How your vite.config.js and capacitor.config.json might look now: </summary>

```
//vite.config.js
import { sveltekit } from '@sveltejs/kit/vite';
import { defineConfig } from 'vite';

export default defineConfig({
	plugins: [sveltekit()],
	server: {
		host: '0.0.0.0',
		port: 5173,
	  }
});

//capacitor.config.json
{
  "appId": "japanese.bryanhogan.me",
  "appName": "learn-japanese",
  "webDir": "build",
  "server": {
    "url": "http://10.0.2.2:5173",
    "cleartext": true
  }
}
```

</details>

Now to make running the server as well as starting the android emulator easier I made it all into one command which you can run with `pnpm run android-dev`.

For Windows add this to the `package.json` and then under `scripts`:  
`"android-dev": "start /B pnpm run dev -- --host && pnpm run build && npx cap sync && npx cap open android"`

For Mac and Linux use the Unix based one: `"android-dev": "pnpm run dev --host & pnpm run build && npx cap sync && npx cap open android"`

## Relevant docs

Some relevant documentation:

- Svelte & SvelteKit: [svelte.dev](https://svelte.dev/)
- Capacitor: [capacitorjs.com](https://capacitorjs.com/)
- Another blog post also about integrating Capacitor into SvelteKit: [ionic.io/blog](https://ionic.io/blog/cross-platform-sveltekit-capacitor-application-yes-its-possible)

## Hosting it

Hosting on Cloudflare is easy, just go to pages (for hosting a static page, not the one for server-side rendered apps) and then change one setting, change the Build output directory to `/build`.

## Further recommendations

Now our current tech-stack looks like this:
- SvelteKit with an static output
- Capacitor with the Android environment added

Potential considerations:
- The postcss plugin [postcss-preset-env](https://www.npmjs.com/package/postcss-preset-env) is really nice, I can highly recommend it.
- [Tauri](https://v2.tauri.app/) for desktop versions. With Tauri you can create versions for Windows, Linux and macOS.
