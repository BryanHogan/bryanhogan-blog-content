Welcome to my blog! I write about things that I would have loved to know before I knew about them.

## How I create content & write

I use **[Obsidian üè∑Ô∏è](/tags/obsidian)** as a "knowledge management tool". In Obsidian I collect and organize my thoughts and new insights, and I also use it to write my online content.

## Life in Korea & learning Korean

2023 I lived in **[South Korea üè∑Ô∏è](/tags/korea)**, I enjoyed it so much that I extended my stay. Since then I have been improving my Korean, and writing about what makes Korea unique and why I enjoy living there.

My year abroad in Korea also made me interested in seeing life in other countries, especially in Asia.
