I have been [publishing a monthly update](/follow) for more than 2 years now. One section of my update includes cool things I came across on the internet, so I wanted to put together all the cool blog posts and similar I came across until now.

I have filtered out a few posts that were about things that are not that relevant anymore, which was less than a handful though. Some posts are technically not blog posts, but I still think they fit. Links are sorted into groups, sorted by how recently I have shared them.

> I have [my own blog](/blog) as well, but this section is for posts that are **not mine**.
