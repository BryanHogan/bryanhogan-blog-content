I want to say thank you for joining my e-mail newsletter.

I now have around 40 people in this list (as of November 2025)! I have now been writing this e-mail letter regularly for 1,5 years. The list is growing slow and steady. I found that people overestimate how much conversion a frontpage post on for example HackerNews generates.

At the same time I find it fascinating that people can discover me on the internet through just the work I put out there.

I dislike calling my monthly e-mail a newsletter as well. Usually I try to avoid news, it's meaningless noise in my daily life. But on the other hand I like personal news, connections and updates from people I care about, who care about me.

I appreciate having a regular digital interaction that is disconnected from social media, from algorithms, and from all that other toxic baggage modern internet can bring.

Thank you for joining, for replying, for reading it from time to time, for skimming it sometimes, for maybe clicking a link that I've included, or just reading the first few lines to see where I currently am in the world.
