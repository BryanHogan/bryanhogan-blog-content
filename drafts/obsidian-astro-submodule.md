My blog uses markdown files. I love using Obsidian to write markdown. So how do I (and you) easily write markdown based blog posts for framework such as Astro using Obsidian?

Since my website uses Astro I will mention Astro, but this approach works just as well for other static site generators that use markdown like Hugo, Jekyll, Eleventy, Next.js and more.

The best way is: GitHub & Submodules  
Submodules might sound complicated at first, but it really isn't. It just means that our markdown content is another repository and we add that repository to our main repository.

I had previously tried using Symlinks, but that approach does not feel reliable and is gimmicky.

## How to use Obsidian to write Astro markdown content

A quick overview of all the steps:

1. Create folder with markdown content
2. Make this folder into a repository
3. Open folder with Obsidian and add `Git` plugin
4. Add this repository to the main repository
5. Adjust build step so that the new submodule repository is actually used

That's it!

### Step 1: Content folder

First we want to create the folder that has the markdown content. If you also use Astro this is what would be in the `src/content`/ folder.

If you use images or other assets, which you probably do, you want to create another folder for that.

I have two folders:
- `/blog` which contains all the posts written in markdown.
- `/blog-assets` which contains things like images that I show within my blog posts.

### Step 2: Create repository

Now we want to create a repository for this content.

This means we will have one repository where our all files for the Astro project live, such as all the components, pages, layouts, styles files and everything else you need for your website, and another repository with just the two folders we created earlier.

Make sure you have Git installed on your device. You can use the visual interface in something like Visual Studio Code which should make this easier for you. But to make it short you will do these steps in your command line interface: `git init` -> `git add *` -> `git commit -m "commit message"` -> `git push`.

### Step 3: Obsidian and `Git` plugin

Within Obsidian open the file as a new vault that contains the two folders.

Add the community plugin `Git`. Since we have already created and linked the content to a repository the plugin will already know where to pull and push the content to.

### Step 4: Submodule magic

Now we will be adding the
